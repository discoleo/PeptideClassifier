		"use a weighted distance based on the centrality of each point. A point Pi would be weighted by the distance to the center/centroid of its corresponding cluster, e.g. D|Pi â€“ Centroid| + 1, where the factor + 1 ensures that the distance will not vanish for points very close to the centroid. The weighted distance between 2 points is then the product between the actual distance and the 2 weights.",
		"The weighted distance for points far apart from the corresponding centers is therefore inflated, minimising the impact of such points. The factor +1 could be tuned, e.g. by using the standard error of the mean in the corresponding cluster.",
		fluidRow(""),
		b("Combined Single & Complete Linkage: "),
		"combine the single linkage with the complete linkage and use the sum between the 2 distances.",
		"The maximum distance will counteract the effect of a single pair of very close points.",
		### Analysis:
		h2("Analysis"),
		# McQuitty:
		h3("McQuitty Method:"),
		"Around half of the leaves join other leaves to form a micro-cluster.",
		"The remaining leaves are solitary leaves which join a micro- or mini-cluster.",
		"Only very few solitary leaves join a macro-cluster.",
		"The micro-clusters merge together to form larger mini-clusters and then macro-clusters.",
		"There is a good partitioning into medium-sized and large-sized clusters.",
		### Shortcomings:
		h2("Shortcomings"),
		# Median Linkage:
		h3("Median Linkage:"),
		"There are very few micro-clusters (2 leaves), a few mini-clusters and virtually no macro-clusters.",
		"Almost all leaves join the tree as solitary leaves.",
		"The solitary leaves join sequentially to a single very large \"branch\".",
		# Average Linkage:
		h3("Average Linkage:"),
		"There are very few macro-clusters.",
		"Many micro- and mini-clusters join one of the large branches, which grows sequentially to a larger size.",
		"Most leaves form actually micro-clusters, which merge then to mini-clusters.",
		"However, the method seems to sequentially add many of these small clusters to a bigger branch.",
		"It merges very rarely 2 larger clusters! This is easily seen on sub-trees and
		when pruning a tree: a pruning size of over 100 is needed to get a sparser tree.",
		"It may be less suited to classify biologically active peptides and infer similar receptor affinities.",
